## About

I am a researcher working in computational neuroscience and machine learning.

## Research Philosophy

I believe that understanding the brain requires a combination of theoretical frameworks, computational modeling, and close collaboration with experimentalists. My work bridges multiple scales and approaches, from single neurons to large-scale brain networks, always with the goal of understanding how neural computations support complex behavior.
